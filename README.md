# AlphaK

November 2021 - Present

Machine learning software that can detect handwritten digits on a homework organizer

# How it Works
Data entry can be very time consuming to do manually, so AlphaK offers a faster solution: a machine learning alogrithm. 

The program will take in an image of a homework sheet, and extract the information needed for data entry.

# Implementation

Images of homework sheets are obtained: using a phone scanner or other software:

Location of name and Student ID are found:

Each segment of the image is run though machine learning software:
